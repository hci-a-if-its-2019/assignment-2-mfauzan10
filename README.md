# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences

## Original
User can't find fixture or result details, Current match of player, and confusing arrow under the player's table

## Solution 1
There is a fixture or result details' table under the field image, user can see current, previous, or next match. And there is also show the current match of player that can see under the player icon.

## Solution 2
The difference with solution 1 is location of 'save' button. In solution 2, the 'save' button is located under the field image and there is 'easy-understanding' arrow under the player list.

## Solution 3
Same with solution 1 and solution 2, but in solution 3, there is difference search box, and show the player's list by click the player icon at certain position. If we click the player icon that has 'Midfielder' position, the player list's table will show player that has a midfielder position. So, all the search boxes categpry will change, i.e search by team, sort by (category).

### 3. Selected Sketch
Among 3 solutions above, I prefer to use solution 3 as the selected sketch. Because it more interactive and informative for user (player) that play fantasy football.

### 4. Design Rationale
The main problem of the original design is lack of information about fixture and result details, user need to open the new page just to know the fixture or result details.

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
- Physical input : mouse and keyboard
- Min. screen size : 14 inch
- Screen Color : RGB

### 2. Users
- Familiar using web browser and fantasy football game
- Have a lot information about football

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
